There are several variants of chlorophyll (chlorophyll a, chlorophyll a', chlorophyll b, chlorophyll c1, chlorophyll c2, and chlorophyll d).

While many organisms are capable of de novo CoA biosynthesis from 3-methyl-2-oxobutanoate and L-aspartate via (R)-pantothenate (vitamin B5), animals and some pathogenic microbes require exogenous (R)-pantothenate for CoA synthesis. In mammals, a deficiency of vitamin B5 can cause many systemic consequences such as impaired motor response, depressed heme synthesis and altered growth.

    "summary": "This pathway shows the degradation of glucose through the periplasmic glucose catabolites gluconate and 2-dehydro-D-gluconate (2-ketogluconate) in several pseudomonads. Depending upon conditions, in aerobically grown Pseudomonas aeruginosa extracellular glucose can be catabolized by either the physphorylative pathway, or the oxidative pathway [Hunt83]. In the oxidative pathway, glucose is oxidized to gluconate and 2-dehydro-D-gluconate in the periplasm by membrand-bound, cytochrome-linked dehydrogenases. The conversion of D-glucono-1,5-lactone to gluconate can occur spontaneously in solution, or be catalyzed by a lactonase, although information on which mechanism is operative in the periplasm of these organisms was not found. At neutral and alkaline pH, lactone hydrolysis to gluconate is favored, while at low pH the lactone is more stable [vanDijken02]. 2-Dehydro-D-gluconate (2-ketogluconate) is thought to be actively transported into the cell where it is degraded by the reactions indicated here. A putative 2-ketogluconate utilization operon (kgu) has been identified in this organism [Swanson00].

This apparent paradox of valine stimulation of step one followed by valine inhibition of step two is a product of the preference of AHAS III for processing of the isoleucine precursor 2-oxobutanoate rather than the valine precursor pyruvate. When valine is abundant in the cell, both AHAS enzymes are inhibited, blocking valine production and potentially disrupting isoleucine synthesis as well. However, the stimulation of threonine deaminase generates a substantial pool of 2-oxobutanoate. Combined with the high affinity of AHAS III for this compound, this allows the isoleucine synthesis to continue despite inhibition caused by the parallel valine synthesis pathway.",

The purines urate, guanine and xanthine are readily decomposed by these organisms, while growth on hypoxanthine is appreciably slower, and adenine does not support growth at all [Barker42]. The slow growth on hypoxanthine was explained upon the characterization of the enzyme xanthine dehydrogenase from Clostridium cylindrosporum. The enzyme was shown to catalyze not only the reversible conversion of urate to xanthine, but also the oxidation of most other substrates, sometimes requiring multiple steps, eventually converging at xanthine. While the enzyme is able to oxidize hypoxanthine to xanthine, this reaction proceeded very slowly [Rabinowitz56].",

    "summary": "Phytate (phytic acid) is the most abundant myo-inositol phosphate (hexakisphosphate) in plant cells. Phytate serves as a storage form of myo-inositol, phosphate and mineral nutrients for utilization during seed germination and seedling growth. It is deposited within single-membrane storage organelles referred to as protein bodies and is usually present as mixed complexes with minerals (K+, Mg2+, Ca2+, Fe2+, Zn2+) known as phytin [Raboy01, Raboy96]. Up to 80% of the total seed phosphorus is stored in phytin [Coelho05]. Although phytate is found in large quantities in seeds, it is also present in other plant tissues and organs such as pollen, roots, tuber and turions (for review see [Raboy03]). The potential of phytate to form very stable complexes with mineral and proteins confers upon this molecule its notorious antinutritional properties. Humans and monogastric animals lack the hydrolytic phytases in their digestive tract. Therefore, the high concentrations of phytate in food grains and its ability to chelate mineral cations compromise mineral absorption. Undigested phytate in animal waste also contributes to eutrophication and environmental phosphorus pollution [Raboy01, BrinchPedersen02]. The degradation of phytate is achieved by a group of enzymes called phytases which have been mostly studied in microorganisms and plants. Phytases belong to a special class of phosphomonoesterases and are capable of initiating the stepwise release of phosphate from phytate. Phytases are used to reduce the level of phosphate pollution in areas of intensive animal production. Addition of adequate amounts of microbial phytases in animal feed improves the utilization of phosphate from phytate, allowing for a reduction in inorganic phosphate supplementation in the diets for simple-stomached animals. As a result, the fecal phosphate excretion of these animals may be reduced by up to 50%. Finally, phytases can improve the nutritional value of plant-based foods (especially grains) by increasing the availability of the minerals chelated in phytin.",

The heterocysts are surrounded by a thick wall that protects the oxygen-sensitive nitrogenase from the oxygen produced during photosynthesis. The heterocysts provide the vegetative cells with fixed nitrogen, and the vegetative cells provide the heterocysts with reduced carbon, mainly in the form of sucrose, through intercellular molecular transfer [Nurnberg15]. The fixed nitrogen is stored in the heterocysts in the form of cyanophycin, a high-molecular weight copolymer composed of an L-aspartate backbone and L-arginine side groups, with typical size of 25-100 kDa. The arginine moieties are linked to the \u03b2-carboxyl group of each aspartate by their \u03b1-amino group (see cyanophycin metabolism).",

The predator is killed, encased in resin and expelled from the bore point of entry (a process called 'pitching out'). This process has the dual function of killing and expelling the predator, but also to form a physical barrier around the wound through evaporation of the oleoresin turpentine which allows the resin acids to seal the wound [Croteau85, Gijzen93]. Oleoresin is composed in roughly equal parts of volatile turpentine (a mixture of monoterpenes and sesquiterpenes) and rosin (also known as diterpene resin acids). The exact composition of turpentine and rosin varies from one conifer species to the next, as well as depending on the resin-producing tissue analyzed [Trapp01].
