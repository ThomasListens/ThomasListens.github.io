In the oxidative pathway, glucose is oxidized to gluconate and 2-dehydro-D-gluconate in the periplasm by membrand-bound, cytochrome-linked dehydrogenases. The conversion of D-glucono-1,5-lactone to gluconate can occur spontaneously in solution, or be catalyzed by a lactonase, although information on which mechanism is operative in the periplasm of these organisms was not found. At neutral and alkaline pH, lactone hydrolysis to gluconate is favored, while at low pH the lactone is more stable [vanDijken02]. 2-Dehydro-D-gluconate (2-ketogluconate) is thought to be actively transported into the cell where it is degraded by the reactions indicated here.
